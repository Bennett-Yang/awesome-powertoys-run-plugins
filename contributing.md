# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it.
- If you submit a plugin that is similar to an existing plugin in the list, argue how it's better.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested plugins should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[plugin](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Link to the GitHub repo, not nuget.org or its website.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Descriptions should not be marketing taglines.
- Descriptions should not be title-case.
- Don't mention `PowerToys Run` in the description as it's implied.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the plugin and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
